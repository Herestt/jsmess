JSMESS
======
JSMESS is an attempt to port [MESS](http://mess.org/) /
[MAME](http://mamedev.org/) to JavaScript using
[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

Why?
----
[Jason Scott](http://jsmess.textfiles.com/) says it best:
> The MESS program can emulate (or begin to emulate) a majority of home
> computers, and continues to be improved frequently. By porting this program
> into the standardized and cross-platform Javascript language, it will be
> possible to turn computer history and experience into the same embeddable
> object as movies, documents, and audio enjoy.

Building
--------
To build JSMESS, read [How to build and test JSMESS](https://github.com/jsmess/jsmess/wiki/How-to-build-and-test-JSMESS-0.142).

Status of JSMESS
----------------
Jason Scott's [JSMESS](http://jsmess.textfiles.com) site has demos for most working systems now.
We are working toward [v1.0](https://github.com/jsmess/jsmess/wiki/JSMESS-v1.0-Systems).
